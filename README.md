# Discord Webhook Tool v2
This is a tool for sending Discord webhooks.

# New Features
__NEW!__ Added support for line breaks.
<br>New windows can now be opened easily. This makes it easier to open multiple windows (I originally planned to use tabs, but it was not possible with my knowledge).

# Known bugs
_**There are no plans to fix these**_
* Selecting "Quit" in the main window will close all windows.

# Appearance
Download and find out for yourself!


# **Previous Version**
If you need an earlier version, you can download it from [here](https://github.com/YuuyaGitHub/Yuuya-Software/raw/main/Discord%20WebHook%20Tool.exe).
<br>However, there is no source code distribution.
